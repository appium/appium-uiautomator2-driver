[![Release](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver/actions/workflows/publish.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver/actions/workflows/publish.js.yml)


Appium UiAutomator2 Driver is a test automation framework for Android devices. Appium UiAutomator2 Driver automates native, hybrid and mobile web apps, tested on emulators and real devices. Appium UiAutomator2 Driver is part of the [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) mobile test automation tool. The driver operates in scope of [W3C WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) with several custom extensions to cover operating-system specific scenarios.

UiAutomator2 Driver proxies most of the commands to [UiAutomator2 server](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-server), which uses Google's [UiAutomator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-automator) framework under the hood. Some commands are proxied directly to [appium-adb](https://github.com/appium/appium-adb) and other helpers built on top of Android platform tools.

> **Note**
>
> Since version 2.0.0 UiAutomator2 driver has dropped the support of Appium 1, and is only compatible to Appium 2.
> Use the `appium driver install uiautomator2` command to add it to your Appium 2 dist.


## Requirements

On top of standard Appium requirements UiAutomator2 driver also expects the following prerequisites:

- Windows, Linux and macOS are supported as hosts
- [Android SDK Platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) must be installed. [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio) also provides a convenient UI to install and manage the tools.
- ANDROID_HOME or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT [environment variable](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables) must be set
- Java JDK must be installed and [JAVA_HOME](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux) environment variable must be set. Android SDK below API 30 requires Java 8. Android SDK 30 and above requires Java 9 or newer.
- [Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) platform image must be installed if you plan to run your tests on it. [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio) also provides a convenient UI to install and manage emulators.
- Real Android devices must have [USB debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) and should be visible as `online` in `adb devices -l` output.
- The minimum version of Android API must be 5.0 (API level 21) (6.0 is recommended as version 5 has some known compatibility issues).


## Capabilities

### General

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
platformName | Could be set to `android`. Appium itself is not strict about this capability value if `automationName` is provided, so feel free to assign it to any supported platform name if this is needed, for example, to make Selenium Grid working.
appium:automationName | Must always be set to `uiautomator2`. Values of `automationName` are compared case-insensitively.
appium:deviceName | The name of the device under test (actually, it is not used to select a device under test). Consider setting `udid` for real devices and `avd` for emulators instead
appium:platformVersion | The platform version of an emulator or a real device. This capability is used for device autodetection if `udid` is not provided
appium:udid | UDID of the device to be tested. Could be retrieved from `adb devices -l` output. If unset then the driver will try to use the first connected device. Always set this capability if you run parallel tests.
appium:noReset | Prevents the device to be reset before the session startup if set to `true`. This means that the application under test is not going to be terminated neither its data cleaned. `false` by default
appium:fullReset | Being set to `true` always enforces the application under test to be fully uninstalled before starting a new session. `false` by default
appium:printPageSourceOnFindFailure | Enforces the server to dump the actual XML page source into the log if any error happens. `false` by default.

### Driver/Server

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:systemPort | The number of the port on the host machine used for the UiAutomator2 server. By default the first free port from 8200..8299 range is selected. It is recommended to set this value if you are running [parallel tests](#parallel-tests) on the same machine.
appium:skipServerInstallation | Skip the UiAutomator2 Server component installation on the device under test and all the related checks if set to `true`. This could help to speed up the session startup if you know for sure the correct server version is installed on the device. In case the server is not installed or an incorrect version of it is installed then you may get an unexpected error later. `false` by default
appium:uiautomator2ServerLaunchTimeout | The maximum number of milliseconds to wait util UiAutomator2Server is listening on the device. `30000` ms by default
appium:uiautomator2ServerInstallTimeout | The maximum number of milliseconds to wait util UiAutomator2Server is installed on the device. `20000` ms by default
appium:uiautomator2ServerReadTimeout | The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a HTTP response from UiAutomator2Server. Only values greater than zero are accepted. If the given value is too low then expect driver commands to fail with `timeout of Xms exceeded` error. `240000` ms by default
appium:disableWindowAnimation | Whether to disable window animations when starting the instrumentation process. `false` by default
appium:skipDeviceInitialization | If set to `true` then device startup checks (whether it is ready and whether Settings app is installed) will be canceled on session creation. Could speed up the session creation if you know what you are doing. `false` by default

### App

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:app | Full path to the application to be tested (the app must be located on the same machine where the server is running). Both `.apk` and `.apks` application extensions are supported. Could also be an URL to a remote location. If neither of the `app`, `appPackage` or `browserName` capabilities are provided then the driver starts from the Dashboard and expects the test knows what to do next. Do not provide both `app` and `browserName` capabilities at once.
browserName | The name of the browser to run the test on. If this capability is provided then the driver will try to start the test in Web context mode (Native mode is applied by default). Read [Automating hybrid apps](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details. Usually equals to `chrome`.
appium:appPackage | Application package identifier to be started. If not provided then UiAutomator2 will try to detect it automatically from the package provided by the `app` capability. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appActivity | Main application activity identifier. If not provided then UiAutomator2 will try to detect it automatically from the package provided by the `app` capability. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appWaitActivity | Identifier of the first activity that the application invokes. If not provided then equals to `appium:appActivity`. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appWaitPackage | Identifier of the first package that is invoked first. If not provided then equals to `appium:appPackage`. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appWaitDuration | Maximum amount of milliseconds to wait until the application under test is started (e. g. an activity returns the control to the caller). `20000` ms by default. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:androidInstallTimeout | Maximum amount of milliseconds to wait until the application under test is installed. `90000` ms by default
appium:appWaitForLaunch | Whether to block until the app under test returns the control to the caller after its activity has been started by Activity Manager (`true`, the default value) or to continue the test without waiting for that (`false`).
appium:intentCategory | Set an optional intent category to be applied when starting the given appActivity by [Activity Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am). Defaults to `android.intent.category.LAUNCHER`. Please use [mobile:startActivity](#mobile-startactivity) in case you don't set an explicit value.
appium:intentAction | Set an optional intent action to be applied when starting the given appActivity by [Activity Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am). Dfaults to `android.intent.action.MAIN`. Please use [mobile:startActivity](#mobile-startactivity) in case you don't set an explicit value.
appium:intentFlags | Set an optional intent flags to be applied when starting the given appActivity by [Activity Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am). Defaults to `0x10200000` (FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED flags). Please use [mobile:startActivity](#mobile-startactivity) in case you don't set an explicit value.
appium:optionalIntentArguments | Set an optional intent arguments to be applied when starting the given appActivity by [Activity Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am)
appium:dontStopAppOnReset | Set it to `true` if you don't want the application to be restarted if it was already running. If `appium:noReset` is falsy, then the app under test is going to be restarted if either this capability is falsy (the default behavior) or `appium:forceAppLaunch` is set to `true`. `false` by default
appium:forceAppLaunch | Set it to `true` if you want the application under test to be always forcefully restarted on session startup even if `appium:noReset` is `true`, and the app was already running. If `noReset` is falsy, then the app under test is going to be restarted if either this capability set to `true` or `appium:dontStopAppOnReset` is falsy (the default behavior). `false` by default. Available since driver version 2.12
appium:shouldTerminateApp | Set it to `true` if you want the application under test to be always terminated on session end even if `appium:noReset` is `true`. If `noReset` is falsy, then the app under test is going to be terminated if `appium:dontStopAppOnReset` is also falsy (the default behavior). `false` by default
appium:autoLaunch | Whether to launch the application under test automatically (`true`, the default value) after a test starts
appium:autoGrantPermissions | Whether to grant all the requested application permissions automatically when a test starts(`true`). The targetSdkVersion in the application manifest must be greater or equal to 23 and the Android version on the device under test must be greater or equal to Android 6 (API level 23) to grant permissions. Applications whose targetSdkVersion is lower than or equal to 22 must be reinstalled to grant permissions, for example, by setting the `appium:fullReset` capability as `true` for Android 6+ devices. If your app needs some special security permissions, like access to notifications or media recording, consider using [mobile: changePermissions](#mobile-changepermissions) extension with `appops` target. `false` by default
appium:otherApps | Allows to set one or more comma-separated paths to Android packages that are going to be installed along with the main application under test. This might be useful if the tested app has dependencies
appium:uninstallOtherPackages | Allows to set one or more comma-separated package identifiers to be uninstalled from the device before a test starts
appium:allowTestPackages | If set to `true` then it would be possible to use packages built with the test flag for the automated testing (literally adds `-t` flag to the `adb install` command). `false` by default
appium:remoteAppsCacheLimit | Sets the maximum amount of application packages to be cached on the device under test. This is needed for devices that don't support streamed installs (Android 7 and below), because ADB must push app packages to the device first in order to install them, which takes some time. Setting this capability to zero disables apps caching. `10` by default.
appium:enforceAppInstall | If set to `true` then the application under test is always reinstalled even if a newer version of it already exists on the device under test. This capability has no effect if `appium:noReset` is set to `true`. `false` by default

### App Localization

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:localeScript | Canonical name of the locale to be set for the app under test, for example `Hans` in `zh-Hans-CN`. See https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html for more details.
appium:language | Name of the language to extract application strings for. Strings are extracted for the current system language by default. Also sets the language for the app under test. See https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html for more details. If `language` is provided then `locale` is also required to be set. The combination of both capability values must be a known locale and should be present in the list of available locales returned by the ICU's [getAvailableULocales()](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/locale/#usage-retrieving-locales) method. The full list of supported locales is also dumped into the logcat output on failure. Example: `en`, `ja`
appium:locale | Sets the locale for the app under test. See https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html for more details. If `locale` is provided then `language` is also required to be set. The combination of both capability values must be a known locale and should be present in the list of available locales returned by the ICU's [getAvailableULocales()](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/locale/#usage-retrieving-locales) method. The full list of supported locales is also dumped into the logcat output on failure. Example: `US`, `JP`

### ADB

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:adbPort | Number of the port on the host machine where ADB is running. `5037` by default
appium:remoteAdbHost | Address of the host where ADB is running (the value of `-H` ADB command line option). Unset by default
appium:adbExecTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until single ADB command is executed. `20000` ms by default
appium:clearDeviceLogsOnStart | If set to `true` then UiAutomator2 deletes all the existing logs in the device buffer before starting a new test
appium:buildToolsVersion | The version of Android build tools to use. By default UiAutomator2 driver uses the most recent version of build tools installed on the machine, but sometimes it might be necessary to give it a hint (let say if there is a known bug in the most recent tools version). Example: `28.0.3`
appium:skipLogcatCapture | Being set to `true` disables automatic logcat output collection during the test run. `false` by default
appium:suppressKillServer | Being set to `true` prevents the driver from ever killing the ADB server explicitly. Could be useful if ADB is connected wirelessly. `false` by default
appium:ignoreHiddenApiPolicyError | Being set to `true` ignores a failure while changing hidden API access policies. Could be useful on some devices, where access to these policies has been locked by its vendor. `false` by default.
appium:mockLocationApp | Sets the package identifier of the app, which is used as a system mock location provider since Appium 1.18.0+. This capability has no effect on emulators. If the value is set to `null` or an empty string, then Appium will skip the mocked location provider setup procedure. Defaults to Appium Setting package identifier (`io.appium.settings`). Termination of a mock location provider application resets the mocked location data.
appium:logcatFormat | The log print format, where `format` is one of: `brief` `process` `tag` `thread` `raw` `time` `threadtime` `long`. `threadtime` is the default value.

'*' means '*:d' and `tag` by itself means `tag:v`. If not specified on the commandline, filterspec is set from ANDROID_LOG_TAGS. If no filterspec is found, filter defaults to '*:I'.
appium:allowDelayAdb | Being set to `false` prevents emulator to use `-delay-adb` feature to detect its startup. See https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/14773 for more details.

### Emulator (Android Virtual Device)

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:avd | The name of Android emulator to run the test on. The names of currently installed emulators could be listed using `avdmanager list avd` command. If the emulator with the given name is not running then it is going to be launched on automated session startup.
appium:avdLaunchTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until Android Emulator is started. `60000` ms by default
appium:avdReadyTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until Android Emulator is fully booted and is ready for usage. `60000` ms by default
appium:avdArgs | Either a string or an array of emulator [command line arguments](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline). If arguments contain the `-wipe-data` one then the emulator is going to be killed on automated session startup in order to wipe its data.

appium:networkSpeed | Sets the desired network speed limit for the emulator. It is only applied if the emulator is not running before the test starts. See emulator [command line arguments](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline) description for more details.
appium:gpsEnabled | Sets whether to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) GPS service in the Emulator. Unset by default, which means to not change the current value
appium:isHeadless | If set to `true` then emulator starts in headless mode (e.g. no UI is shown). It is only applied if the emulator is not running before the test starts. `false` by default.

### App Signing

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:useKeystore | Whether to use a custom keystore to sign the app under test. `false` by default, which means apps are always signed with the default Appium debug certificate (unless canceled by `noSign` capability). This capability is used in combination with `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities.
appium:keystorePath | The full path to the keystore file on the server filesystem. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:keystorePassword | The password to the keystore file provided in `keystorePath` capability. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:keyAlias | The alias of the key in the keystore file provided in `keystorePath` capability. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:keyPassword | The password of the key in the keystore file provided in `keystorePath` capability. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:noSign | Set it to `true` in order to skip application signing. By default all apps are always signed with the default Appium debug signature if they don't have any. This capability cancels all the signing checks and makes the driver to use the application package as is. This capability does not affect `.apks` packages as these are expected to be already signed.

### Device Locking

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:skipUnlock | Whether to skip the check for lock screen presence (`true`). The default driver behaviour is to verify the presence of the screen lock (e.g. 'false' value of the capability) before starting the test and to unlock that (which sometimes might be unstable). Note, that this operation takes some time, so it is highly recommended to set this capability to `true` and disable screen locking on device(s) under test.
appium:unlockType | Set one of the possible types of Android lock screens to unlock. Read the [Unlock tutorial](https://github.com/appium/appium-android-driver/blob/master/docs/UNLOCK.md) for more details.

appium:unlockStrategy | Either 'locksettings' (default) or 'uiautomator'. Setting it to 'uiautomator' will enforce the driver to avoid using special ADB shortcuts in order to speed up the unlock procedure.
appium:unlockSuccessTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until the device is unlocked. `2000` ms by default

### MJPEG

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:mjpegServerPort | The number of the port on the host machine that UiAutomator2 server starts the MJPEG server on. If not provided then the screenshots broadcasting service on the remote device does not get exposed to a local port (e.g. no adb port forwarding is happening)
appium:mjpegScreenshotUrl | The URL of a service that provides realtime device screenshots in MJPEG format. If provided then the actual command to retrieve a screenshot will be requesting pictures from this service rather than directly from the server

### Web Context

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:autoWebview | If set to `true` then UiAutomator2 driver will try to switch to the web view with name `WEBVIEW_ + appium:appPackage` after the session is started. For example, if `appium:appPackage` capability is set to `com.mypackage` then `WEBVIEW_com.mypackage` will be used. `false` by default.
appium:autoWebviewName | Set the name of webview context in which UiAutomator2 driver will try to switch if `autoWebview` capability is set to `true` (available since driver version 2.9.1). Has priority over using the `appium:appPackage` value in webview name. For example, if `appium:autoWebviewName` capability is set to `myWebviewName` then `WEBVIEW_myWebviewName` will be used. Unset by default.
appium:autoWebviewTimeout | Set the maximum number of milliseconds to wait until a web view is available if `autoWebview` capability is set to `true`. `2000` ms by default.

appium:ensureWebviewsHavePages | Whether to skip web views that have no pages from being shown in `getContexts` output. The driver uses devtools connection to retrieve the information about existing pages. `true` by default since Appium 1.19.0, `false` if lower than 1.19.0.
appium:enableWebviewDetailsCollection | Whether to retrieve extended web views information using devtools protocol. Enabling this capability helps to detect the necessary chromedriver version more precisely. `true` by default since Appium 1.22.0, `false` if lower than 1.22.0.
appium:chromedriverPort | The port number to use for Chromedriver communication. Any free port number is selected by default if unset.
appium:chromedriverPorts | Array of possible port numbers to assign for Chromedriver communication. If none of the port in this array is free then an error is thrown.
appium:chromedriverArgs | Array of chromedriver [command line arguments](http://www.assertselenium.com/java/list-of-chrome-driver-command-line-arguments/). Note, that not all command line arguments that are available for the desktop browser are also available for the mobile one.
appium:chromedriverExecutable | Full path to the chromedriver executable on the server file system.
appium:chromedriverExecutableDir | Full path to the folder where chromedriver executables are located. This folder is used then to store the downloaded chromedriver executables if automatic download is enabled. Read [Automatic Chromedriver Discovery article](#automatic-discovery-of-compatible-chromedriver) for more details.
appium:chromedriverChromeMappingFile | Full path to the chromedrivers mapping file. This file is used to statically map webview/browser versions to the chromedriver versions that are capable of automating them. Read [Automatic Chromedriver Discovery article](#automatic-discovery-of-compatible-chromedriver) for more details.
appium:chromedriverUseSystemExecutable | Set it to `true` in order to enforce the usage of chromedriver, which gets downloaded by Appium automatically upon installation. This driver might not be compatible with the destination browser or a web view. `false` by default.
appium:chromedriverDisableBuildCheck | Being set to `true` disables the compatibility validation between the current chromedriver and the destination browser/web view. Use it with care.
appium:recreateChromeDriverSessions | If this capability is set to `true` then chromedriver session is always going to be killed and then recreated instead of just suspending it on context switching. `false` by default
appium:nativeWebScreenshot | Whether to use screenshoting endpoint provided by UiAutomator framework (`true`) rather than the one provided by chromedriver (`false`, the default value). Use it when you experience issues with the latter.
appium:extractChromeAndroidPackageFromContextName | If set to `true`, tell chromedriver to attach to the android package we have associated with the context name, rather than the package of the application under test. `false` by default.
appium:showChromedriverLog | If set to `true` then all the output from chromedriver binary will be forwarded to the Appium server log. `false` by default.
pageLoadStrategy | One of the available page load strategies. See https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#capabilities
appium:chromeOptions | A mapping, that allows to customize chromedriver options. See https://chromedriver.chromium.org/capabilities for the list of available entries.
appium:chromeLoggingPrefs | Chrome logging preferences mapping. Basically the same as [goog:loggingPrefs](https://newbedev.com/getting-console-log-output-from-chrome-with-selenium-python-api-bindings). It is set to `{"browser": "ALL"}` by default.

### Other

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:disableSuppressAccessibilityService | Being set to `true` tells the instrumentation process to not suppress accessibility services during the automated test. This might be useful if your automated test needs these services. `false` by default
appium:userProfile | Integer identifier of a [user profile](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user). By default the app under test is installed for the currently active user, but in case it is necessary to test how the app performs while being installed for a user profile, which is different from the current one, then this capability might come in handy.
appium:newCommandTimeout | How long (in seconds) the driver should wait for a new command from the client before assuming the client has stopped sending requests. After the timeout the session is going to be deleted. `60` seconds by default. Setting it to zero disables the timer.
appium:skipLogCapture | Skips to start capturing logs such as logcat. It might improve network performance. Log-related commands won't work if the capability is enabled. Defaults to `false`.

xpath | For elements lookup Xpath strategy the driver uses the same XML tree that is generated by page source API. Only Xpath 1.0 is supported for appium-uiatomator2-server versions below 4.25.0. All server versions starting from 4.25.0 support both Xpath 1.0 and 2.0 | `⭐⭐⭐` | By.xpath("//android.view.View[@text=\"Regular\" and @checkable=\"true\"]")


## Parallel Tests

It is possible to execute tests in parallel using UiAutomator2 driver.
Appium allows to do this on per-process (multiple server processes running on different ports managing single session)
or per-request basis (single server process managing multiple sessions, more preferable, uses less resources and ensures better control over running sessions).

_Note_: If you are not going to run your tests in parallel then consider enabling the `--session-override` Appium server argument.
It forces the server to close all pending sessions before a new one could be opened,
which allows you to avoid possible issues with such sessions silently running/expiring in the background.

### Important Real Device Capabilities

- `udid`: The unique device id.
- `systemPort`: Set a unique system port number for each parallel session. Otherwise you might get a port conflict such as in [this issue](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/7745).
- `chromedriverPort`: The unique chromedriver port if testing web views or Chrome.
- `mjpegServerPort`: Set a unique MJPEG server port for each parallel session if you are going to record a video.

### Important Emulator Capabilities

- `avd`: The unique emulator name.
- `systemPort`: Set a unique system port number for each parallel session.
- `chromedriverPort`: The unique chromedriver port (if testing web views or Chrome).
- `mjpegServerPort`: Set a unique MJPEG server port for each parallel session if you are going to record a video.


## Settings API

UiAutomator2 driver supports Appium [Settings API](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/settings/).
Along with the common settings the following driver-specific settings are currently available:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
actionAcknowledgmentTimeout | long | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait for an acknowledgment of generic uiautomator actions, such as clicks, text setting, and menu presses. The acknowledgment is an[AccessibilityEvent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityEvent.html") corresponding to an action, that lets the framework determine if the action was successful. Generally, this timeout should not be modified. `3000` ms by default
allowInvisibleElements | boolean | Whether to include elements that are not visible to the user (e. g. whose `displayed` attribute is `false`) to the XML source tree. `false` by default
ignoreUnimportantViews | boolean | Enables or disables layout hierarchy compression. If compression is enabled, the layout hierarchy derived from the Acessibility framework will only contain nodes that are important for uiautomator testing. Any unnecessary surrounding layout nodes that make viewing and searching the hierarchy inefficient are removed. `false` by default
elementResponseAttributes | string | Comma-separated list of element attribute names to be included into findElement response. By default only element UUID is present there, but it is also possible to add the following items: `name`, `text`, `rect`, `enabled`, `displayed`, `selected`, `attribute/<element_attribute_name>`. It is required that `shouldUseCompactResponses` setting is set to `false` in order for this one to apply.
enableMultiWindows | boolean | Whether to include all windows that the user can interact with (for example an on-screen keyboard) while building the XML page source (`true`). By default it is `false` and only the single active application window is included to the page source.
enableTopmostWindowFromActivePackage | boolean | Whether to limit the window with the highest Z-order from the active package for interactions and page source retrieval. By default it is `false` and the active application window, which may not necessarily have this order, is included to the page source.
enableNotificationListener | boolean | Whether to enable (`true`) toast notifications listener to listen for new toast notifications. By default this listener is enabled and UiAutomator2 server includes the text of toast messages to the generated XML page source, but not for longer than `3500` ms after the corresponding notification expires.
keyInjectionDelay | long | Delay in milliseconds between key presses when injecting text input. 0 ms by default
scrollAcknowledgmentTimeout | long | Timeout for waiting for an acknowledgement of an uiautomator scroll swipe action. The acknowledgment is an [AccessibilityEvent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityEvent.html), corresponding to the scroll action, that lets the framework determine if the scroll action was successful. Generally, this timeout should not be modified. `200` ms by default
shouldUseCompactResponses | boolean | Used in combination with `elementResponseAttributes` setting. If set to `false` then the findElement response is going to include the items enumerated in `elementResponseAttributes` setting. `true` by default
waitForIdleTimeout | long | Timeout used for waiting for the user interface to go into an idle state. By default, all core uiautomator objects except UiDevice will perform this wait before starting to search for the widget specified by the object's locator. Once the idle state is detected or the timeout elapses (whichever occurs first), the object will start to wait for the selector to find a match. Consider lowering the value of this setting if you experience long delays while interacting with accessibility elements in your test. `10000` ms by default.
waitForSelectorTimeout | long | Timeout for waiting for a widget to become visible in the user interface so that it can be matched by a selector. Because user interface content is dynamic, sometimes a widget may not be visible immediately and won't be detected by a selector. This timeout allows the uiautomator framework to wait for a match to be found, up until the timeout elapses. This timeout is only applied to `android uiautomator` location strategy. `10000` ms by default
normalizeTagNames | boolean | Being set to `true` applies unicode-to-ascii normalization of element class names used as tag names in the page source XML document. This is necessary if the application under test has some Unicode class names, which cannot be used as XML tag names by default due to known bugs in Android's XML DOM parser implementation. `false` by default
shutdownOnPowerDisconnect | boolean | Whether to shutdown the server if the device under test is disconnected from a power source (e. g. stays on battery power). `true` by default.
simpleBoundsCalculation | boolean | Whether to calculate element bounds as absolute values (`true`) or check if the element is covered by other elements and thus partially hidden (`false`, the default behaviour). Setting this setting to `true` helps to improve the performance of XML page source generation, but decreases bounds preciseness. Use with care.
trackScrollEvents | boolean | Whether to apply scroll events tracking (`true`, the default value), so the server could calculate the value of `contentSize` attribute. Having this setting enabled may add delays to all scrolling actions.
wakeLockTimeout | long | The timeout in milliseconds of wake lock that UiAutomator2 server acquires by default to prevent the device under test going to sleep while an automated test is running. By default the server acquires the lock for 24 hours. Setting this value to zero forces the server to release the wake lock.
serverPort | int | The number of the port on the remote device to start UiAutomator2 server on. Do not mix this with `systemPort`, which is acquired on the host machine. Must be in range 1024..65535. `6790` by default
mjpegServerPort | int | The number of the port on the remote device to start MJPEG screenshots broadcaster on. Must be in range 1024..65535. `7810` by default
mjpegServerFramerate | int | The maximum count of screenshots per second taken by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..60. `10` by default
mjpegScalingFactor | int | The percentage value used to apply downscaling on the screenshots generated by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..100. `50` is by default, which means that screenshots are downscaled to the half of their original size keeping their original proportions.
mjpegServerScreenshotQuality | int | The percentage value used to apply lossy JPEG compression on the screenshots generated by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..100. `50` is by default, which means that screenshots are compressed to the half of their original quality.
mjpegBilinearFiltering | boolean | Controls whether (`true`) or not (`false`, the default value) to apply bilinear filtering to MJPEG screenshots broadcaster resize algorithm. Enabling this flag may improve the quality of the resulting scaled bitmap, but may introduce a small performance hit.
useResourcesForOrientationDetection | boolean | Defines the strategy used by UiAutomator2 server to detect the original device orientation. By default (`false` value) the server uses device rotation value for this purpose. Although, this approach may not work for some devices and a portrait orientation may erroneously be detected as the landscape one (and vice versa). In such case it makes sense to play with this setting.
enforceXPath1 | boolean | Since UiAutomator2 driver version `4.25.0` XPath2 is set as the default and the recommended interpreter for the corresponding element locators. This interpreter is based on [Psychopath XPath2](https://wiki.eclipse.org/PsychoPathXPathProcessor) implementation, which is now a part of the Eclipse foundation. In most of the cases XPath1 locators are also valid XPath2 locators, so there should be no issues while locating elements. Although, since the XPath2 standard is much more advanced in comparison to the previous version, some [issues](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/16142) are possible for more sophisticated locators, which cannot be fixed easily, as we depend on the third-party library mentioned above. Then try to workaround such issues by enforcing XPath1 usage (whose implementation is a part of the Android platform itself) and assigning this setting to `true`. Note, this setting is actually applied at the time when the element lookup by XPath is executed, so you could switch it on or off whenever needed throughout your automated testing session.
limitXPathContextScope | boolean | Due to historical reasons UiAutomator2 driver limits scopes of element context-based searches to the parent element. This means a request like `findElement(By.xpath, "//root").findElement(By.xpath, "./..")` would always fail, because the driver only collects descendants of the `root` element for the destination XML source. The `limitXPathContextScope` setting being set to `false` changes that default behavior, so the collected page source includes the whole page source XML where `root` node is set as the search context. With that setting disabled the search query above should not fail anymore. Although, you must still be careful while building XPath requests for context-based searches with the `limitXPathContextScope` setting set to `false`. A request like `findElement(By.xpath, "//root").findElement(By.xpath, "//element")` would ignore the current context and search for `element` trough the whole page source. Use `.` notation to correct that behavior and only find `element` nodes which are descendants of the `root` node: `findElement(By.xpath, "//root").findElement(By.xpath, ".//element")`.
disableIdLocatorAutocompletion | boolean | According to internal Android standards it is expected that each resource identifier is prefixed with `<packageName>:id/` string. This should guarantee uniqueness of each identifier. Although some application development frameworks ignore this rule and don't add such prefix automatically or, rather, let it up to the developer to decide how to represent their application identifiers. For example, [testTag modifier attribute in the Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/platform/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).testTag(kotlin.String)) with [testTagsAsResourceId](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/semantics/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.semantics.SemanticsPropertyReceiver).testTagsAsResourceId()) allows developers to set an arbitrary string without the prefix rule. [Interoperability with UiAutomator](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing) also explains how to set it. By default UIA2 driver adds the above prefixes automatically to all resource id locators if they are not prefixed, but in case of such "special" apps this feature might be disabled by assigning the setting to `true`.
includeExtrasInPageSource | boolean | Whether to include `extras` element attribute in the XML page source result. Then, XPath locator can find the element by the extras. Its value consists of combined [getExtras](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfo#getExtras()) as `keys=value` pair separated by a semicolon (`;`), thus you may need to find the element with partial matching like `contains` e.g. `driver.find_element :xpath, '//*[contains(@extras, "AccessibilityNodeInfo.roleDescription=")]'`. The value could be huge if elements in the XML page source have large `extras`. It could affect the performance of XML page source generation.
snapshotMaxDepth | int | The number of maximum depth for the source tree snapshot. The default value is `70`. This number should be in range [1, 500]. A part of the elements source tree might be lost if the value is too low. Also, StackOverflowError might be caused if the value is too high (Issues [12545](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/12545), [12892](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/12892)). The available driver version is `2.27.0` or higher.


## Platform-Specific Extensions

Beside of standard W3C APIs the driver provides the following custom command extensions to execute platform specific scenarios:

### mobile: shell

Executes the given shell command on the device under test via ADB connection. This extension exposes a potential security risk and thus is only enabled when explicitly activated by the `adb_shell` server command line feature specifier.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
command | string | yes | Shell command name to execute, for example `echo` or `rm` | echo
args | Array&lt;string&gt; | no | Array of command arguments | `['-f', '/sdcard/myfile.txt']`
timeout | number | no | Command timeout in milliseconds. If the command blocks for longer than this timeout then an exception is going to be thrown. The default timeout is `20000` ms | 100000
includeStderr | boolean | no | Whether to include stderr stream into the returned result. `false` by default | true

#### Returned Result

Depending on the `includeStderr` value this API could either return a string, which is equal to the `stdout` stream content of the given command or a dictionary whose elements are `stdout` and `stderr` and values are contents of the corresponding outgoing streams. If the command exits with a non-zero return code then an exception is going to be thrown. The exception message will be equal to the command stderr.

### mobile: execEmuConsoleCommand

Executes a command through emulator telnet console interface and returns its output.
The `emulator_console` server feature must be enabled in order to use this method.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
command | string | yes | The actual command to execute. See [Android Emulator Console Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-console) for more details on available commands | help-verbose
execTimeout | number | no | Timeout used to wait for a server reply to the given command in milliseconds. `60000` ms by default | 100000
connTimeout | boolean | no | Console connection timeout in milliseconds. `5000` ms by default | 10000
initTimeout | boolean | no | Telnet console initialization timeout in milliseconds (the time between the connection happens and the command prompt). `5000` ms by default | 10000

#### Returned Result

The actual command output. An error is thrown if command execution fails.

### Mobile Gesture Commands

UiAutomator2 provides several extensions that allow to automate popular mobile gesture shortcuts:

- mobile: dragGesture
- mobile: flingGesture
- mobile: doubleClickGesture
- mobile: clickGesture
- mobile: longClickGesture

### mobile: performEditorAction

Performs IME action on the _currently focused_ edit element.

Very often Android developers use [onEditorAction](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.OnEditorActionListener.html#onEditorAction(android.widget.TextView,%20int,%20android.view.KeyEvent)) callback with `actionId` argument to implement actions handling, for example, when `Search` or `Done` button is pressed on the on-screen keyboard. This mobile extension is supposed to emulate the invokation of such callback on the focused element.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
action | string | yes | The name or an integer code of the editor action to be executed. The following action names are supported: `normal, unspecified, none, go, search, send, next, done, previous`. Read [EditorInfo](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/inputmethod/EditorInfo) for more details on this topic. | search

#### Examples

// Java
driver.executeScript("mobile: performEditorAction", ImmutableMap.of("action", "Go"));
```

```python
# Python
driver.execute_script('mobile: performEditorAction', {'action': 'previous'})
```

### mobile: startScreenStreaming

Starts device screen broadcast by creating MJPEG server. Multiple calls to this method have no effect unless the previous streaming session is stopped. This method only works if the `adb_screen_streaming` feature is enabled on the server side. It is also required that [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) with `gst-plugins-base`, `gst-plugins-good` and `gst-plugins-bad` packages are installed and available in PATH on the server machine.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
width | number | no | The scaled width of the device's screen. If unset then the script will assign it to the actual screen width measured in pixels. | 768
height | number | no | The scaled height of the device's screen. If unset then the script will assign it to the actual screen height measured in pixels. | 1024
bitRate | number | no | The video bit rate for the video, in bits per second. The default value is 4000000 (4 Mb/s). You can increase the bit rate to improve video quality, but doing so results in larger movie files. | 1024000
host | string | no | The IP address/host name to start the MJPEG server on. You can set it to `0.0.0.0` to trigger the broadcast on all available network interfaces. `127.0.0.1` by default | 0.0.0.0
pathname | string | no | The HTTP request path the MJPEG server should be available on. If unset then any pathname on the given `host`/`port` combination will work. Note that the value should always start with a single slash: `/` | /myserver
tcpPort | number | no | The port number to start the internal TCP MJPEG broadcast on. This type of broadcast always starts on the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`). `8094` by default | 5024
port | number | no | The port number to start the MJPEG server on. `8093` by default | 5023
quality | number | no | The quality value for the streamed JPEG images. This number should be in range [1, 100], where 100 is the best quality. `70` by default | 80
considerRotation | boolean | no | If set to `true` then GStreamer pipeline will increase the dimensions of the resulting images to properly fit images in both landscape and portrait orientations. Set it to `true` if the device rotation is not going to be the same during the broadcasting session. `false` by default | false
logPipelineDetails | boolean | no | Whether to log GStreamer pipeline events into the standard log output. Might be useful for debugging purposes. `false` by default | true

### mobile: stopScreenStreaming

Stop the previously started screen streaming. If no screen streaming server has been started then nothing is done.

### mobile: getNotifications

Retrieves Android notifications via Appium Settings helper. Appium Settings app itself must be *manually* granted to access notifications under device Settings in order to make this feature working. Appium Settings helper keeps all the active notifications plus notifications that appeared while it was running in the internal buffer, but no more than 100 items altogether. Newly appeared notifications are always added to the head of the notifications array. The `isRemoved` flag is set to `true` for notifications that have been removed.
See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/StatusBarNotification and https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html for more information on available notification properties and their values.

#### Returned Result

The example output is:
```json
{
   "statusBarNotifications":[
     {
       "isGroup":false,
       "packageName":"io.appium.settings",

## Applications Management

UiAutomator2 driver supports Appium endpoints for applications management:
- Check if app is installed ([mobile: isAppInstalled](#mobile-isappinstalled))
- Install/upgrade app ([mobile: installApp](#mobile-installapp))
- Activate app ([mobile: activateApp](#mobile-activateapp))
    - Since UIAutomator2 driver v2.2.0, the server calls `am start`/`am start-activity` to start the application on devices with API level 24+. [monkey](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/other-testing-tools/monkey) tool is called on devices below API level 24.
    - UIAutomator2 driver v2.1.2 and lower versions call the `monkey` tool on all devices.
    - The `monkey` tool [turns on auto rotation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56684778/adb-shell-monkey-command-changing-device-orientation-lock), so please consider using [mobile: startActivity](#mobile-startactivity) if you would like to keep your current rotation preferences.
- Uninstall app ([mobile: removeApp](#mobile-removeapp))
- Terminate app ([mobile: terminateApp](#mobile-terminateapp))
- Start app activity ([mobile: startActivity](#mobile-startactivity))
- Query the current app state ([mobile: queryAppState](#mobile-queryappstate))
- Background app ([mobile: backgroundApp](#mobile-backgroundapp))

## Hybrid Mode

UIA2 driver supports automation of web pages opened in mobile Chrome or Chromium, and
hybrid apps that use Chrome-based web views, by managing a
[Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) instance and
proxying commands to it when necessary.

The following endpoints are used to control the current context:

- POST `/session/:sessionId/context`: To set the current context. The body contains a single mandatory `name` parameter, which has the name of the context to be set. The name of the default context is `NATIVE_APP`.
- GET `/session/:sessionId/context`: To retrieve the name of the current context
- GET `/session/:sessionId/contexts`: To retrieve the list of available context names
- [mobile: getContexts](#mobile-getcontexts)

By default the driver starts in the native context, which means that most of REST API commands are being
forwarded to the downstream [appium-uiautomator2-server](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-server).
This server is running on the device under test, and trasforms API commands to appropriate low-level UiAutomator framework calls. There is always only one native context, although multiple web contexts are possible.
Each web context could contain zero or more pages/windows. It is possible to start UIA2 driver session in web context by default by setting the `browserName` capability value or by enabling the `appium:autoWebview` capability.

Web context(s) could be detected if a browser or a web view is active on the device. If a context is switched to
a web one then UIA2 driver spins up a Chromedriver instance for it and forwards most of the commands
to that Chromedriver instance. Note that web views must be properly configured and
debuggable in order to connect to them or get their names in the list of available contexts.
The availablity of a particular web view could be easily verified by using
[Chrome Remote Debugger](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/).
You could switch between different contexts (and windows in them) at any time during the session.

The [appium-chromedriver](https://github.com/appium/appium-chromedriver) package bundled with UIA2 always
tries to download the most recent version of Chromedriver known to it. Google requires that the used Chromedriver version must always match to the version of the browser or a web view engine being automated. If these versions do not match then Chromedriver fails its creation, and context switch API shows a failure message
similar to:

```
An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.
Original error: unknown error: Chrome version must be >= 55.0.2883.0
```

To work around this issue it is necessary to provide UIA2 driver with a proper Chromedriver binary
that matches to the Chrome engine version running on the device under test.
Read the [Chromedriver/Chrome compatibility](#chromedriverchrome-compatibility) topic below to
know more about finding a matching Chromedriver executable.

There are several ways to provide a customized Chromedriver to UIA2 driver:

#### When installing the driver

Specify the Chromedriver version in the `CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION` environment variable:

```bash
CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION=2.20 appium install driver uiautomator2
```

#### When starting a session (manual discovery)

Chromedriver version can be specified in session capabilities, by providing the
`appium:chromedriverExecutable` [capability](#web-context),
containing the full path to a matching Chromedriver executable, which must be manually
downloaded and put to the server file system.

#### When starting a session (automated discovery)

UIA2 driver could also try to detect the version of the target Chrome engine and
download matching chromedriver for it automatically if it does not exist on the local file system.
Read the [Automatic discovery of compatible Chromedriver](#automatic-discovery-of-compatible-chromedriver)
topic below for more details.

### Chromedriver/Chrome Compatibility

Since version *2.46* Google has changed their rules for Chromedriver versioning, so now the major Chromedriver version corresponds to the major web view/browser version, that it can automate. Follow the [Version Selection](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads/version-selection) document in order to manually find the Chromedriver, that supports your current browser/web view if its major version is equal or above *73*.

To find the minimum supported browsers for older Chromedriver versions (below *73*), get the
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)
[source code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/get_the_code.md),
check out the release commit, and check the variable `kMinimumSupportedChromeVersion`
in the file `src/chrome/test/chromedriver/chrome/version.cc`. (To find the
release commits, you could use `git log --pretty=format:'%h | %s%d' | grep -i "Release Chromedriver version"`.)

The complete list of available Chromedriver releases and release notes is located at [Chromedriver Storage](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html).

The list of Chromedriver versions and their matching minimum
Chrome versions known to appium-chromedriver package is stored at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appium/appium-chromedriver/master/config/mapping.json

### Automatic Discovery of Compatible Chromedriver

UIA2 driver is able to pick the correct Chromedriver for the
version of Chrome/web view under test. While appium-chromedriver only comes bundled with the Chromedriver
most recently released at the time of the corresponding package version's release, more Chromedriver
versions could be downloaded and placed into a custom location indicated to UIA2 driver via the `appium:chromedriverExecutableDir` [capability](#web-context).

A custom mapping of Chromedrivers to the minimum
Chrome/web view version they support could be given to UIA2 driver through the
`appium:chromedriverChromeMappingFile` [capability](#web-context). This should be the
absolute path to a file with the mapping
in it. The contents of the file needs to be parsable as a JSON object, like:

```json
{
  "2.42": "63.0.3239",
  "2.41": "62.0.3202"
}
```

There is a possibility to automatically download the necessary chromedriver(s) into `appium:chromedriverExecutableDir` from the official Google storage. The script will automatically search for the newest chromedriver version that supports the given browser/web view, download it (the hash sum is verified as well for the downloaded archive) and add to the `appium:chromedriverChromeMappingFile` mapping. Everything, which is needed to be done from your side is to execute the server with `chromedriver_autodownload` feature enabled (like `appium server --allow-insecure chromedriver_autodownload`).

### Troubleshooting Chromedriver Download Issues

When UIA2 driver is installed it automatically downloads Chromedriver, so there is a possibility
of network or other issues leading to an installation failure.

By default Chromedriver is retrieved from `https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/`.
To use a mirror of the above URL change the value of `CHROMEDRIVER_CDNURL` environemnt variable:

```bash
CHROMEDRIVER_CDNURL=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/chromedriver appium driver install uiautomator2
```

It may also be necessary to adjust network proxy and firewall settings for the above to work.

In case you would like skip the download of Chromedriver entirely, do it by
defining the `APPIUM_SKIP_CHROMEDRIVER_INSTALL` environment variable:

```bash
APPIUM_SKIP_CHROMEDRIVER_INSTALL=1 appium driver install uiautomator2
```

### W3C Support in Web Context

Chromedriver did not follow the W3C standard until version 75. If you encounter proxy command error like [this issue](https://github.com/appium/python-client/issues/234), please update your Chromedriver version.
Old Android devices can't use newer Chromedriver versions. You could avoid the error if you enforce
Mobile JSON Wire Protocol for Chromedriver. This could be done by providing `{'w3c': False}` item
to `appium:chromeOptions` capability value.
Since major version *75* W3C mode is the default one for Chromedriver, although it could be still switched to JSONWP one as described above (keep in mind that eventually Chromedriver will drop the support of
JSON Wire protocol completely).
The history of W3C support in Chromedriver is available for reading at
[downloads section](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).


## Troubleshooting

### Activity Startup

If you experince issues with application activities being not found or not starting then consider checking [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) article.

### Poor Elements Interaction Performance

If you observe automated tests need at least 10 seconds or more to locate/interact with a single element then consider changing the default value for [waitForIdleTimeout setting](#settings-api). By default, UiAutomator framework (and all other Accessiblity-based frameworks) always waits for the accessibility event stream to become idle before interacting with it (the default timeout there is 10000ms). This is needed to make sure all animations/transitions are finished before you, for example, interact with an element by clicking it. In case the application under test constantly runs some background animations or hogs the accessibility event stream in some other way these waits may significatly slow down the automation flow.

Setting the value of `waitForIdleTimeout` to zero `0` ms should completely disable any waits, and enforce interactions to happen immediately ignoring the accessibility event stream state. The downside of that would be that all interactions are never going to be delayed, so clicks and other actions might happen at wrong places of the application UI. That is why is it important to check the app under test first and fix its source to get rid of activities hogging the event loop. Sometimes it makes sence to disable animations completely for the app build under test, which could speed up your flows significantly in some situations.

> **Warning**
> `waitForIdleTimeout` is a setting, not a capability.

### Session Startup Issues

Sometimes various legacy driver parts might be cached on the device under test (like settings.apk), which would prevent a new/upgraded driver version from starting a session. Run

```bash
appium driver run uiautomator2 reset
```

in order to cleanup the cached UIA2 driver binaries from all connected devices on the current machine.

### Socket Hangup Error

This type of error means the driver is unable to connect to the UiAutomator2 REST server, which is running on the device under test. There might be multiple causes to this issue:
- The automation session gets unexpectedly deleted if your test code sends the `DELETE /session/<id>` request to the it, also the corresponding session and the server itself are terminated as a result. Sending further commands to the same server would create the error above because it is not listening anymore and must be newly started by the instrumentation first. Such issues usually happen if the session management is not configured properly in the your code, so one starts a new session while an existing one is still running and has not been quit properly, or there is a timeout while waiting for a new command. Fixing session management logic (e.g. make sure each session is being properly created in the test setup section and is terminated in the test teardown) or changing/disabling the commands timeout (check the [newCommandTimeout capability](#other)) might help to address such type of errors.
- The server has been unexpectedly killed by Android OS itself. There might be several reasons to that. Usually fetching the [logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat) output and finding occurrences of `io.appium.uiautomator2.server` traces with `error` or `exception` label might help to figure out what happens. Sometimes it is necessary to turn off some internal phone optimizations, sometimes the server crashes because of an internal UiAutomator framework bug, sometimes because of a bug in the server code itself. Each case should be investigated separately if the search over the internet shows no matches…
- The connectivity between the phone and the host is unstable. Nothing much to add on this one. Maybe the phone has a defect, or the USB cable is damaged, or the installed Android SDK is out of date…

### Element(s) Cannot be Found

All element location strategies in UIA2 driver work similarly under the hood except of the xpath one.
If some element is not found, but you see/assume it is present in the page source then make sure no race condition
happens. Add a timer and wait for a couple of seconds before giving up on the element location. In case the lookup
still fails after the timeout and your non-xpath locator is used then, most likely, it contains a typo, or the
destination element is not present. There is not much that could be done in UIA2 to change/influence that, since it passes such lookup calls directly to Google's UiAutomator framework.

In case of _xpath_ locators you could try to change values of the following settings:

1. [allowInvisibleElements](#settings-api)
2. [ignoreUnimportantViews](#settings-api)
3. [enableMultiWindows](#settings-api)

By default, the first setting is set to `false`, which hides
elements that are not visible from the the page source and from the xpath location. Changing the setting value
to `true` would add such invisible elements to the page source and make them locatable.

The second one is enabled by default (e.g. `true`). By disabling it the page source could receive more elements
that are normally hidden, because of their unimportance.

The third setting being set to `true` extends the page source by adding the actual content of other windows that are currently present on the device's screen. For example, the on-screen keyboard in Android is not a part of the current app hierarchy, but rather belongs to a separate window.

In case of _id_ locators you could try to change the value of the following setting:

1. [disableIdLocatorAutocompletion](#settings-api)

The general resources naming convention for Android apps is `<app_id>:id/<resource_name>`. This should guarantee uniqueness of each identifier accross the user interface. Although, this is only a convention and it is still allowed to have various resource names that do not follow it. If you have gotten one of such applications for automated testing then consider assigning `disableIdLocatorAutocompletion` setting value to `true`, so UiAutomator2 driver does not automatically rewrite supplied id values by adding `<app_id>:id/` prefixes to them.

> **Warning**
> Default values for settings above have been selected to optimize xpath lookup and page source generation performance.
> Having these settings always different from their default values may sometimes significantly (especially in case of huge accessbility hierarchies) reduce xpath lookup and page source generation speed.

> **Warning**
> All items above are settings, not capabilities.

### ClassCastException: java.util.ArrayList$ListItr cannot be cast to org.eclipse.wst.xml.xpath2.processor

This exception happens due to a known bug in the [Eclipse's Psychopath](https://wiki.eclipse.org/PsychoPathXPathProcessor) library used by UiAutomator2 driver to support [XPath2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/) syntax. The issue has been observed while using `following::` or `preceding::` axes in xpath queries. Unfortunately, this library has not been maintained for quite a while, and there is no good open source alternative to it. The only known workaround would be to forcefully switch the driver's XPath processor to the standard Android's Apache Harmony-based XPath1, which does not have this issue (but also does not support XPath2 syntax). See the Appium issue [#16142](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/16142#issuecomment-1003954166) for more details.
